# roma

A YouTube Music client for Android, Linux and Windows. It romanizes every non-Latin title, artist and lyric line, and its controls stay in the same place.

Tiny and fast: the whole app is a 1.7 MB download; romanizing Japanese needs an optional dictionary, downloaded separately. Install it and tap around; that shows the speed better than a benchmark.

- **Romanization everywhere:** lists, player, queue, search, lyrics, notification.
  - Japanese: [Sudachi](https://github.com/WorksApplications/Sudachi) with SudachiDict core, Hepburn.
  - Korean: Revised Romanization.
  - Chinese: pinyin.
  - Cyrillic: per-language national standards (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Serbian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Mongolian).
  - Greek and others through ICU.
  - Official Latin names win; user corrections can be scoped to a string, a song or an artist.
- **Fixed controls:** a control never moves or disappears. If it isn't available, it's dimmed in place.
- **Lyrics:** all providers are queried in parallel and one result is chosen deterministically against YouTube Music's own text. Word-level karaoke on the original and the romanization, plus a translation layer.
- **Playback:** the current song keeps playing until the next one can start. Optional radio drift limits, duplicate and ban filters.
- **Last.fm scrobbling** with the original metadata, using your own API key.
- **No Google Play Services needed.**

The design and its rules are in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

## Build

Requirements: JDK 21 and the Android SDK (compileSdk 37).

```sh
./gradlew :core:test :app:assembleDebug
```

The core tests and the dictionary app need SudachiDict: their first build downloads it (about 77 MB, checked against a pinned sha256) into the Gradle cache. Building roma itself doesn't.

Release builds are made with `tools/release.sh`: R8 shrinking, Zopfli-recompressed, signed with a key that you supply in `keystore.properties` (not in the repository). A merge to master that sets a new `versionName` builds and publishes it as a GitHub release (`.github/workflows/release.yml`); there's no tag to push.

The desktop app shares the Android app's screens and logic (`shared/`, see [docs/design.md](docs/design.md#desktop-2026-10-29)). Its packages need a JDK with `jmods` (Temurin 21 has them, Temurin 24 and later don't):

```sh
./gradlew :desktop:run                      # run it
tools/linux-packages.sh                     # dist/roma_<version>_amd64.deb and dist/roma-<version>-1.x86_64.rpm
```

Its first build also builds roma-aac (`tools/build-ffmpeg.sh`, needs musl-gcc: Debian's and Ubuntu's `musl-tools`), the small ffmpeg that decodes the few songs YouTube has only in AAC.

## Install

### Android

Get `roma-<version>.apk` from [Releases](https://github.com/zakius/roma/releases). If you want Japanese romanized, roma offers to install its Japanese dictionary on the first start: a separate app (`roma-dict-…`, a 31 MB download, 63 MB installed), so roma's own updates stay small.

### Linux

[Releases](https://github.com/zakius/roma/releases) has two packages for x86_64, which run on your distribution's Java (21 or newer):

| File | For |
|------|-----|
| `roma_*_amd64.deb` | Debian 13, Ubuntu 24.04 and newer: `sudo apt install ./roma_*_amd64.deb` |
| `roma-*.x86_64.rpm` | Fedora: `sudo dnf install ./roma-*.x86_64.rpm` |

### Windows

`roma-*-x64.msi` installs for your user without administrator rights; `roma-*-windows-x64.zip` is the same app to unpack and run (`roma.exe`). Both use your Java 21 or newer, or download [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net)'s on the first start (about 49 MB). `roma-*-x64-full.msi` includes Java.

### On the desktop

The Japanese dictionary downloads on the first start if you want Japanese romanized (31 MB). Signing in and some songs need a Chromium-family browser (Chrome, Edge, Chromium, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, oganesson…); roma starts it with its own profile, never yours. Without one, roma downloads Chromium (CEF, about 150 MB) when first needed. Esc and the mouse's back button go back.
